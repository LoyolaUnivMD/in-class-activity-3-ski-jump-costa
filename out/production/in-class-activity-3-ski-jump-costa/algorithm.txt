1. Ask the user what kind of hill they will be skiing on
    1a. while the user does not input large hill or normal hill, ask again for an input
2. Ask the user how fast they were going in m/s
3. Calculate how long they were in the air using the formula sqrt((2*height)/9.8)
4. Calculate the distance that they travelled using the formula jumpers speed*time in air
5. Calculate how many points they earned using the formula 60 + (distance - par)*points_per_meter
6. Output their distance and points
7. If the users points are 61 or higher, output "Great job for doing better that par"
    7a. Otherwise, if the users points are less than 10, output "What happened?!"
    7b. Otherwise, output "Sorry you didn't go very far"
